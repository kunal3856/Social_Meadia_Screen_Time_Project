# Social_Meadia_Screen_Time_Project

### Overview 
This project is focused on analysing the screen time usage for different age group people, This is one of my favourite topics to analyze as the digitalization happening the major problem at the time is of mobile addiction, Back in time when technology wasn't developed as much people used to spend 2-3 hours daily on mobile/social_media but now a days this average time spend has increased to 5-6 hours a day, which is noticeable.  

### Data Sources

Social-Media-Users-Dataset: I have taken the fictional dataset from the kaggle website and have tried to perform  the analysis using Ms-Excel

### Tools
- Excel: For Data cleaning and analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The process involves exploring the dataset to answer the key questions, such as;

1. Average time spent on Social media apps by users?
2. Different addiction levels, users fall in?
3. Which platform does users use the most?

### Data Analysis 
I have added an area chart representing the average time spent by any user with respect to their age, that will help us analysing which age group people use social media significantly, the pie chart will help to identify the addiction level of individual categories along with regional data and all of it can be modified by use of slicers to dive deeper into different categories and get useful insights, that will help us take suitable actions to reduce our social media usage if required.
